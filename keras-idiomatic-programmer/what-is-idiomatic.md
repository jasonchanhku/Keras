# Idiomatic Teaching

The material in this repo is designed for the idiomatic teaching method. It differs from the traditional A-Z methodology. In A-Z,
education/training material is split into a set of tasks (A, B, C...) and then sequenced into a progression (start at A and end at Z).

The vast proponderance of education/training material available (and its quite vast) for machine learning and artificial intelligence 
is of the A-Z method. At Google Developer Relations, we have heard from software developers that it's not working. They say they
can go through the material, complete exercises, pass quizzes, etc -- yet it still doesn't click. Personally, as an educator, I have
heard this frequently.

In Idiomatic teaching, one teaches patterns, and how those patterns are connected. Many will feel instead of starting at the beginning
and doing a vertical progression, one starts in the middle and then spirals around -- always teaching patterns and how they connect.
What I have personal found switching from A-Z to Idiomatic teaching of machine learning in 2018, were my students telling me now I get
it --thank you. It's a style of teaching that appears to work universally.

## What are the elements of Idiomatic Teaching

  - It's inclusive - eliminate all gender specific phrasing, and replace with us, we and one.
  - It's welcoming - frequent use of the word let's, where students feel let's learn together.
  - It's lifelong learnning - instructor present themselves not as a master, but master/student -- while having mastered the subject,
                           the instructor continues to learn from the students.
  - It's exploring - eliminate pushing to correct answers, and replace with exercises that push the learner to explore.
  - It's bias free - eliminate rewards for excellence, make learning non-judgemental, reward intiative, intuition and ??
  - <connecting patterns, connecting examples>
  
 <no developer is left behind>
