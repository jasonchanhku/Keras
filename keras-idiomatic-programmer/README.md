# Idiomatic Programmer

This repository contains the handbooks in softcopy (PDF) and code examples from the Idiomatic Programmer
handbook series, as well as presentation packs and accompanying code labs. The Idiomatic Programmer materials are produced by Google AI Developer Relations. The audience for the materials are software engineers wanting to learn machine learning. Our first series focuses on the [Keras](https://keras.io/) framework and computer vision, along with [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).

The material has been designed both for self-learning, and for being incorporating into instructional material for universities, private coding schools, and professional training. Licensed as Apache 2.0 and CC-BY, organizations are free to integrate and customize the material into their curriculum. 

The repository is organized by:

| Directory     | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `src`         | code snippets for handbooks (e.g., handbook1) - Apache 2.0 license |
| `handbooks`   | PDF softcopy of handbooks - CC-BY 4.0 license |
| `workshops`   | workshops (presentation slides and code labs) - CC-BY 4.0 license |
| `zoo`         | tf.keras model zoo (coded in idiomatic programming style) - Apache 2.0 license |
